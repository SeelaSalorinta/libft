# 🏗️ Libft – Building My First C Library

This was my very first project at Hive Helsinki! 🚀 I wrote my own C library by reimplementing essential standard functions from scratch. Along the way, I also created a header file and a Makefile to tie everything together.

The bonus part introduced linked lists, which added an extra challenge. 🧩 Overall, it was a great way to kick off my coding journey, and I had a lot of fun working on it!
